# Development Environment Setup

- Install Python 3.8 (Or create a Python environment with specific version such as using Conda: `conda create -n myenv python=3.8 && conda activate myenv`)
- Install Git LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com)
- Clone/fork this repo

#### Set up environment using the env_setup.sh script provided

- Set up environment: `source env_setup.sh`
  This will set up a Python environment under the `environment/` folder, as well as creating `activate.sh` which can be used for setting the environment variables.
- Edit the environment variables in `activate.sh`. This file is in .gitignore and won't up updated to the repo.
  You can create a random secret key for Django using:
  ```
  from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
  print(get_random_secret_key())
  ```
- Activate the environment: `source activate.sh`. Alternatively, to activate the environment without loading environment variables from activate.sh (ie. using default development configurations), run `source environment/bin/activate` instead.

#### Set up environment not using the env_setup.sh script provided

- With a Python 3.8 environment activated, install the dependencies described in requirements.txt, you can do so using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set up environment variables (optional, you can skip this step if you are using default development configurations)

# Default development configurations

A set of default development configurations will be used unless otherwise specified as environment variables. The default configurations are as the following:

- - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: ...
- - RDS_DB_NAME: "icd_recommender"
- - RDS_USERNAME: "postgres"
- - RDS_PASSWORD: ""
- - RDS_HOSTNAME: "127.0.0.1"
- - RDS_PORT: "5432"
- - FRONT_END_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
- - FRONT_END_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: ...
- - DJANGO_EMAIL_USERNAME: ""
- - DJANGO_EMAIL_PASSWORD: ""

You can overwrite these default values by setting them as environment variables, such as editing the `activate.sh` generated by the `env_setup.sh` provided.

# Typical first time set-up commands

- python manage.py migrate
- python manage.py initialize
- python manage.py createsuperuser
- python manage.py runserver
